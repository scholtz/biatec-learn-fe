# Biatec

First gold and silver coins in usage at 500 BC to 100 BC around Bratislava area were minted with label BIATEC. Slovak National Bank used the Biatec coin image on the official slovak fiat currency before EUR was adopted.

We believe that Algorand and whole AVM ecosystem provides new form of digital identity and payments solutions. The brand name Biatec creates for us historic narrative as we live now the historic moments of early crypto adoption.

Algorand is novel distributed ledger technology (DLT) which does not fork because of efficiency of PPoS. It provides instant transaction finality, sub 3 second economic finality and has highest AMM swap throughput. Users do not pay for failed transactions and each transfer of value even in milions costs less then a penny.
